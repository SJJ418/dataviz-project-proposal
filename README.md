# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [Cost of Living Index by Country 2024 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myrios/cost-of-living-index-by-country-by-number-2024) and [Salary by Job Title and Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/salary-by-job-title-and-country?select=Salary.csv).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * I want to understand the geographical distribution of the cost of living index.
 * I want to see correlation between rent index and groceries index.
 * I want to see correlation between local purchasing power index and the cost of living index.
 * I want to see correlation between the cost of living index dataset and the global country development and prosperity index dataset.
 * I want to understand the geographic distibution of rent index.

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

Below is first sketch of my proposed visualization.

Below are iteration comments for my first visualization sketch.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart that shows the top ten countries by cost of living along with a line graph that represents the median salary in each of those top ten countries.

## Open Questions

I am currently looking into additional channels to represent the data within each set. This may include country selection that could include a radar chart that shows cost of living attributes, or a breakdown of the jobs in each country that median salaries are from.

## Milestones

* Week 8   - Implement full datasets
* Week 9   - Combine line and bar chart
* Week 10  - Explore additional ways to represent individual countries
* Week 11  - Implement individual country representation
* Week 12  - Add tooltips
* Week 13  - Finalize visualization
* Week 14  - Write report
