# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [Cost of Living Index by Country 2024 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myrios/cost-of-living-index-by-country-by-number-2024) and [Salary by Job Title and Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/salary-by-job-title-and-country?select=Salary.csv).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * I want to understand the geographical distribution of the cost of living index.
 * I want to see correlation between rent index and groceries index.
 * I want to see correlation between local purchasing power index and the cost of living index.
 * I want to see correlation between the cost of living index dataset and the global country development and prosperity index dataset.
 * I want to understand the geographic distibution of rent index.

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

Below is first sketch of my proposed visualization.

Below are iteration comments for my first visualization sketch.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart that shows the top ten countries by cost of living along with a line graph that represents the median salary in each of those top ten countries.

## Open Questions

I am currently looking into additional channels to represent the data within each set. This may include country selection that could include a radar chart that shows cost of living attributes, or a breakdown of the jobs in each country that median salaries are from.

## Milestones

* Week 8   - Implement full datasets
* Week 9   - Combine line and bar chart
* Week 10  - Explore additional ways to represent individual countries
* Week 11  - Implement individual country representation
* Week 12  - Add tooltips
* Week 13  - Finalize visualization
* Week 14  - Write report


## Week 8

Full datasets have been implemented into previous data visualizations. At this point, I may be pivoting to add the ability to show additional data per country, one country at a time, instead of just the top ten cross examined with salary. Each country will be selectable.

## Week 9

Direction change for vizualization. Data set applied to world map that allows for country selection (currently mouseover only). Next steps are to include additional data per country selected. This information will appear in a popup when a country is clicked. Possible graphics include radar chart of index breakdown, country rankings and salary display. Any advice on additional information to include or methods to compare countries would be appreciated. Thank you!
